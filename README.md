# Challenge 1 : 
  Create a function to handle the templating of the current message. We want one function that takes the res object as a parameter and returns a nice error message.

   Ex: 
   A GET request for resource MANGAS has been made. Unfortunately, a database is not connected yet, so please come back later.
   A POST request for resource MANGAS has been made, with body data: ..... . Unfortunately database is not connected yet, so please come back later.
   
# Challenge 2 :
  Connect your app to your database, create tables for mangas and authors, and finally, do with your database what your routes say it should do!
